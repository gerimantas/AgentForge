2. **Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Prompting**:
   - Description: Few-shot prompting provides the model with a few examples of task inputs and expected outputs, while zero-shot prompting presents a task without prior examples. These techniques enhance model performance on unfamiliar tasks, allowing for greater flexibility in response generation.
