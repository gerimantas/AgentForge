# Knowledge Base on Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Entry 1
**Topic:** Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Prompting  
**Fact:** Zero-shot prompting involves instructing the model to perform a task without any examples, while few-shot prompting provides a limited number of examples to help guide the model. These techniques are essential for adapting models to new tasks quickly, enhancing their accuracy and effectiveness in generating relevant responses.

**Verified:** Yes  

## Entry 2  
**Topic:** Chain-of-Thought Prompting  
**Fact:** This technique encourages the model to articulate its reasoning by breaking down complex tasks into a series of steps. By guiding the model through a thought process, it can produce more coherent and logical outputs. It is effective in scenarios that require multi-step reasoning, such as problem-solving.

**Verified:** Yes  

## Entry 3  
**Topic:** Active-Prompting and Prompt Chaining  
**Fact:** Active-prompting is a method where prompts are dynamically adjusted based on the model's output to guide it towards better answers. This allows for a more interactive and iterative approach to generating responses. In conjunction with prompt chaining, it can significantly improve the model's ability to handle layered queries and complex instructions.
